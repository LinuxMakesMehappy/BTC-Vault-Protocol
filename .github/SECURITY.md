# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

The Vault Protocol handles Bitcoin commitments and financial transactions, requiring the highest level of security. We take security vulnerabilities seriously and have implemented multiple layers of protection.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### Preferred Method: Private Security Advisory
1. Go to the [Security tab](../../security/advisories) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with detailed information

### Alternative Method: Email
Send an email to: **security@vaultprotocol.com** (if available)

### What to Include
Please include the following information in your report:
- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## üèÜ Security Bounty Program

We offer rewards for security vulnerabilities based on severity:

| Severity | Reward Range | Examples |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Critical** | $5,000 - $25,000 | Remote code execution, private key extraction |
| **High** | $1,000 - $5,000 | Authentication bypass, fund theft |
| **Medium** | $500 - $1,000 | Information disclosure, DoS attacks |
| **Low** | $100 - $500 | Minor information leaks, rate limiting issues |

### Eligibility Requirements
- First to report the vulnerability
- Provide clear reproduction steps
- Do not publicly disclose until we've had time to fix
- Do not access user data or disrupt services
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

## üîí Security Measures

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL, Semgrep, Bandit
- **Dependency Scanning**: Cargo audit, Safety, npm audit
- **License Compliance**: Cargo deny with strict policies
- **Cryptographic Review**: ECDSA implementation audits

### Infrastructure Security
- **Multi-signature Wallets**: All critical operations require multiple signatures
- **Hardware Security Modules**: Private keys stored in HSMs
- **Network Isolation**: Air-gapped systems for key operations
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with MFA

### Development Security
- **Secure Development Lifecycle**: Security reviews at every stage
- **Automated Testing**: 30+ security-focused tests
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Daily security scans
- **Incident Response**: 24/7 security monitoring

## üéØ Security Scope

### In Scope
- **Solana Programs**: All smart contract code in `programs/`
- **Cryptographic Functions**: ECDSA validation, hashing, signatures
- **API Endpoints**: All REST and WebSocket endpoints
- **Frontend Application**: Web interface and client-side code
- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD pipelines, deployment scripts
- **Dependencies**: Third-party libraries and packages

### Out of Scope
- **Social Engineering**: Attacks targeting personnel
- **Physical Security**: Data center or office security
- **Third-party Services**: External APIs we don't control
- **Denial of Service**: Network-level DoS attacks
- **Brute Force**: Password/key brute force attacks

## üìã Security Standards

### Cryptographic Standards
- **ECDSA**: secp256k1 curve for Bitcoin compatibility
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 for all cryptographic hashes
- **Random Number Generation**: Cryptographically secure RNG
- **Key Management**: Hardware-backed key storage

### Code Standards
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system prevents buffer overflows
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information leakage
- **Logging**: Security events logged without sensitive data

### Compliance
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security controls audit
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management
- **GDPR**: Data protection compliance

## üöÄ Response Timeline

| Severity | Initial Response | Status Update | Resolution Target |
|----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | 2 hours | 24 hours | 7 days |
| **High** | 24 hours | 72 hours | 30 days |
| **Medium** | 72 hours | 1 week | 90 days |
| **Low** | 1 week | 2 weeks | Next release |

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- **Daily Security Scans**: Vulnerability assessments
- **Dependency Updates**: Automated security patches
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly external audits
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused peer reviews

### Manual Testing
- **Red Team Exercises**: Simulated attacks
- **Security Audits**: Third-party security firms
