# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Repository Created Successfully! ✅

**Local Git Repository**: Initialized and committed  
**Files**: 68 files with 10,388 lines of code  
**Commit**: Security-First Implementation: Tasks 1-3 Complete  

## Next Steps to Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Create Repository via GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `vault-protocol` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: `Non-custodial Bitcoin commitment protocol with Chainlink oracle integration`
4. Set to **Private** (recommended for security)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Option 2: Create Repository via GitHub CLI (if installed)
```bash
gh repo create vault-protocol --private --description "Non-custodial Bitcoin commitment protocol"
```

## Push to GitHub

Once you have the repository URL, run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote origin (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vault-protocol.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Repository Features to Enable

### 1. Branch Protection Rules
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks (CI/CD)
- Require up-to-date branches
- Include administrators

### 2. Security Features
- Enable Dependabot alerts
- Enable secret scanning
- Enable code scanning (CodeQL)
- Enable vulnerability reporting

### 3. Actions & CI/CD
- Our workflows will automatically run:
  - `ci.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline
  - `security.yml` - Security audit pipeline
  - `task-based-ci.yml` - Task-specific validation

- Use teams for organization access
- Enable 2FA for all contributors
- Regular access reviews

### 📊 **Monitoring**
- Enable GitHub Advanced Security (if available)
- Monitor dependency vulnerabilities
- Track security advisories
- Regular security score reviews
