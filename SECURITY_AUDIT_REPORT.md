**Impact**: Compilation failures, potential runtime panics
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT FIXED

## Low Severity Findings

### 8. Unused Variables and Imports (LOW)

**Issue**: 20+ unused variables and imports
**Impact**: Code bloat, maintenance overhead
**Severity**: LOW
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT FIXED

### 9. Deprecated Function Usage (LOW)

### üîÑ Partially Completed

1. **Panic Prevention**
   - Fixed payment system arithmetic operations
   - Fixed Clock::get() calls in treasury and state channel modules
   - **Remaining**: 100+ unwrap() calls in other modules

2. **Compilation Issues**

## Conclusion

The Vault Protocol demonstrates strong security architecture and awareness of best practices. However, the current implementation contains critical vulnerabilities that must be resolved before production deployment. The most concerning issues are:

1. **Compilation failures** preventing proper testing and deployment
2. **Panic-prone code** that could cause denial of service
3. **Vulnerable dependencies** with known security issues

**Recommendation**: Continue development to address all identified issues before considering production deployment. The protocol shows promise but requires significant additional work to meet production security standards.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix all compilation errors to enable proper testing
2. **Short-term**: Replace all unwrap() calls with proper error handling
3. **Medium-term**: Address dependency vulnerabilities and implement comprehensive testing
4. **Long-term**: Establish ongoing security monitoring and maintenance procedures
