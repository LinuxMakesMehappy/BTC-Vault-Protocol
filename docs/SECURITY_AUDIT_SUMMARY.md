## Implementation Quality Assessment

### ✅ EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATIONS

#### KYC System
```typescript
// Comprehensive tier-based verification
interface KYCProfile {
  tier: 'none' | 'basic' | 'enhanced' | 'institutional';
  status: 'not_started' | 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
  documents: KYCDocument[];
  complianceScreening: ComplianceScreening;
}

// Secure document handling
const documentHash = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', fileBuffer);
```

#### Authentication System
```typescript
// Multi-factor authentication support
interface AuthFactor {
  method: 'totp' | 'webauthn' | 'passkey';
  verified: boolean;
  lastUsed: Date;
  failureCount: number;
}

// Risk-based session management
interface UserSession {
  riskScore: number;
  authMethods: string[];
  status: 'active' | 'expired' | 'revoked';
}
```

#### Security Features
- **Compromise Detection:** Behavioral analysis and anomaly detection
- **Account Lockout:** Automatic protection against attacks
- **Security Events:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Session Security:** Multi-device tracking and risk assessment

### 🔧 AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

#### Error Handling
```rust
// BEFORE (Risky):
let result = operation().unwrap();

// AFTER (Safe):
let result = operation()
    .map_err(|e| VaultError::OperationFailed(e))?;
```

#### Cryptographic Operations
```rust
// Added timing attack protection
pub fn verify_signature_constant_time(&self, ...) -> Result<bool> {
    let start = Instant::now();
    let result = self.verify_signature_internal(...);
    
    // Ensure constant time
    let elapsed = start.elapsed();
    if elapsed < MIN_TIME {
        thread::sleep(MIN_TIME - elapsed);
    }
    
    result
}
```
