# Zero-CVE WebAssembly Migration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for migrating the VaultBTC protocol to a zero-CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) architecture using Rust and WebAssembly. The goal is to eliminate all known security vulnerabilities, reduce the attack surface, and create a more secure, performant, and maintainable system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Zero-CVE Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious protocol operator, I want all dependencies to be free of known vulnerabilities, so that the system has no exploitable security flaws.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is audited THEN it SHALL have zero RUSTSEC advisories
2. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically reject any dependency with known CVEs
3. WHEN new dependencies are added THEN they SHALL be automatically scanned for vulnerabilities before inclusion
4. WHEN a vulnerability is discovered in an existing dependency THEN the system SHALL automatically flag it for immediate remediation
5. IF a critical dependency has a vulnerability THEN the system SHALL provide an alternative implementation or mitigation strategy

### Requirement 2: WebAssembly Core Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the core protocol logic to run in WebAssembly, so that I have better performance, security isolation, and cross-platform compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the protocol executes core functions THEN they SHALL run in a WebAssembly runtime
2. WHEN WebAssembly modules are loaded THEN they SHALL be sandboxed with minimal system access
3. WHEN cryptographic operations are performed THEN they SHALL use WebAssembly-compiled Rust implementations
4. WHEN state transitions occur THEN they SHALL be validated through WebAssembly modules
5. IF WebAssembly execution fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to safe defaults

### Requirement 3: Rust-Only Implementation

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want the entire codebase to be written in Rust, so that I can leverage Rust's memory safety guarantees and eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is analyzed THEN it SHALL contain only Rust code for core functionality
2. WHEN memory operations are performed THEN they SHALL be memory-safe by default
3. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN they SHALL use Rust's ownership system to prevent data races
4. WHEN unsafe code is required THEN it SHALL be minimized, documented, and formally verified
5. IF Python or JavaScript code exists THEN it SHALL be limited to non-critical tooling and testing

### Requirement 4: Cryptographic Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a protocol user, I want all cryptographic operations to use the most secure and up-to-date implementations, so that my assets are protected against cryptographic attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cryptographic operations are performed THEN they SHALL use constant-time implementations
2. WHEN random numbers are generated THEN they SHALL use cryptographically secure random number generators
3. WHEN elliptic curve operations are performed THEN they SHALL use timing-attack resistant implementations
4. WHEN key derivation occurs THEN it SHALL use hardened derivation paths and secure key storage
5. IF cryptographic vulnerabilities are discovered THEN they SHALL be patched within 24 hours

### Requirement 5: Minimal Attack Surface

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the system to have the smallest possible attack surface, so that there are fewer potential entry points for attackers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL expose only necessary interfaces
2. WHEN external dependencies are included THEN they SHALL be minimal and security-audited
3. WHEN network communication occurs THEN it SHALL use secure protocols with proper authentication
4. WHEN file system access is required THEN it SHALL be limited to specific directories with minimal permissions
5. IF system calls are made THEN they SHALL be through a controlled interface with input validation

### Requirement 6: Automated Security Monitoring

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want continuous security monitoring and automated vulnerability detection, so that security issues are identified and addressed immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN it SHALL be automatically scanned for security vulnerabilities
2. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN they SHALL be automatically checked against vulnerability databases
3. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL continuously monitor for security anomalies
4. WHEN a security issue is detected THEN it SHALL automatically alert the security team
5. IF a critical vulnerability is found THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate incident response procedures

### Requirement 7: Formal Verification Integration

**User Story:** As a protocol designer, I want critical protocol logic to be formally verified, so that I can mathematically prove the correctness and security of core operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical state transitions are implemented THEN they SHALL have formal specifications
2. WHEN consensus mechanisms are deployed THEN they SHALL be formally verified for safety and liveness
3. WHEN cryptographic protocols are used THEN they SHALL have formal security proofs
4. WHEN smart contract logic is executed THEN it SHALL be verified against formal specifications
5. IF formal verification fails THEN the code SHALL not be deployed to production

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the system to be highly performant despite increased security measures, so that security doesn't compromise usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebAssembly modules execute THEN they SHALL achieve near-native performance
2. WHEN cryptographic operations are performed THEN they SHALL be optimized for the target architecture
3. WHEN memory is allocated THEN it SHALL use efficient allocation strategies
4. WHEN network requests are made THEN they SHALL be batched and optimized
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL identify and optimize bottlenecks automatically

### Requirement 9: Secure Build Pipeline

**User Story:** As a release engineer, I want the build and deployment pipeline to be secure and reproducible, so that the deployed code matches the audited source code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is built THEN it SHALL use reproducible builds with cryptographic verification
2. WHEN dependencies are fetched THEN they SHALL be verified against known checksums
3. WHEN artifacts are created THEN they SHALL be signed with secure keys
4. WHEN deployments occur THEN they SHALL verify artifact signatures before execution
5. IF build integrity is compromised THEN the deployment SHALL be automatically halted

### Requirement 10: Zero-Trust Architecture

**User Story:** As a security architect, I want the system to implement zero-trust principles, so that no component is implicitly trusted and all interactions are verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components communicate THEN they SHALL authenticate and authorize each interaction
2. WHEN data is processed THEN it SHALL be validated at every boundary
3. WHEN privileges are required THEN they SHALL be granted with minimal necessary scope
4. WHEN trust relationships are established THEN they SHALL be cryptographically verified
5. IF trust verification fails THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
